Bowen considered that the formal methods had great potential benefits in the software testing and described these benefits in
improving software testing quality

Computer Software and Applications, 2002: 91–101.


The software testing techniques based on state can fully verify the event, action and the relationship between state transitions which can help us to
determine whether the system behaviours meet the system requirements.
